    <i>✨ One Eval, Evaluation in One ✨</i>
  </h4>
  <br>

One-Eval is an automated Agent-based evaluation framework for Large Language Models, designed to achieve **NL2Eval**: automatically orchestrating evaluation workflows and generating reports from natural language requirements.\
Built on [DataFlow](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow) and [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), it emphasizes a traceable, interruptible, and scalable evaluation loop.

## 📰 1. News

- **\[2026-06] 🧩 One-Eval is now available as a portable Skill!**\
  Use One-Eval directly inside **Claude Code** (or Codex) — no frontend/backend to launch. Just point Claude Code at this repo and start evaluating. See [Quick Start → Use with Claude Code](#32-use-with-claude-code-recommended).
- **\[2026-03] 🎉 One-Eval (v0.1.0) is officially open-sourced!**\
  We released the first version, supporting full-link automation from natural language to evaluation reports (NL2Eval). Say goodbye to tedious manual scripts and make LLM evaluation as simple, intuitive, and controllable as chatting. Welcome to Star 🌟 and follow!

## 💡 Why One-Eval?

Traditional evaluation frameworks often require users to manually search for benchmarks, download data, and fill in extensive configuration parameters.\
**One-Eval** aims to change this: **Everything that can be automated is handled by the Agent**. From benchmark recommendation to model evaluation, we are committed to providing the most direct and intuitive evaluation experience.

## 🔍 2. Overview

Traditional evaluation often faces pain points such as complex scripts, fragmented processes, and difficulty in reuse. One-Eval reconstructs evaluation into a **graph-based execution process (Graph / Node / State)**, dedicated to creating the next generation of interactive evaluation experience:

- 🗣️ **NL2Eval**: Just input a natural language goal (e.g., "Evaluate the model's performance on math reasoning tasks"), and the system automatically parses the intent and plans the execution path.
- 🧩 **End-to-End Automation**: Automatically completes benchmark recommendation, data preparation, inference execution, metric matching, scoring, and multi-dimensional report generation.
- ⏸️ **Human-in-the-Loop**: Supports interruption and human intervention at key nodes (such as benchmark selection, result review), facilitating real-time adjustment of evaluation strategies based on feedback.
- 📊 **Scalable Architecture**: Based on the DataFlow operator system and LangGraph state management, it easily integrates private datasets and custom metrics.

## ⚡ 3. Quick Start

There are two independent ways to use One-Eval — **pick whichever suits you**:

- **3.1 Use with Claude Code** — zero setup, just paste one line. Best for getting started fast.
- **3.2 Web UI (Frontend + Backend)** — a full interactive interface; requires environment setup.

### 3.1 Use with Claude Code

Zero setup. Just paste this to **Claude Code** (or Codex, or any coding agent):

```text
Use the one-eval-skill in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/One-Eval to get us started on evaluating my model.
```

### 3.2 Web UI (Frontend + Backend)

A full web UI with a separation of frontend and backend architecture.

#### Step 1: Install the environment

We provide two environment management methods: Conda and uv. Choose one:

```bash
# Option A: Conda
conda create -n one-eval python=3.11 -y
conda activate one-eval
pip install -e .

# Option B: uv
uv venv
uv pip install -e .
```

#### Step 2: Start Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
uvicorn one_eval.server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Step 3: Start Frontend (Vite + React)

```bash
cd one-eval-web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit <http://localhost:5173> to start interactive evaluation.

> Note: After starting, please enter the settings interface first to configure parameters such as API, model, and HF Token (to support batch data download), and click save.

## 🗂️ 4. Bench Gallery

One-Eval has a built-in rich **Bench Gallery** for unified management of meta-information of various evaluation benchmarks (such as task type, data format, Prompt template).

> Currently covering mainstream text-only capability dimensions (no complex sandbox environment required):
>
> - 🧮 **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, BBH, AIME...
> - 🌐 **General Knowledge**: MMLU, CEval, CMMLU...
> - 🔧 **Instruction Following**: IFEval...

## 🚀 5. Future Work

We plan to continuously maintain and update One-Eval in the following directions:

- 💻 **Support for Complex Evaluation Scenarios**: Extend support for LLM evaluation fields that require additional execution environments, such as Code and Text2SQL.
- 🤖 **Agentic Evaluation & Sandbox Environments**: Support evaluation in Agentic domains (e.g., SWE-bench) that rely on complex sandbox environments.
- 🌐 **Online Community & Platform**: Deploy an online evaluation platform where users can discuss, build, share, and use their own custom benchmarks.

🙌 **Join Us**: We warmly welcome co-workers to join our open-source project! Feel free to contact us directly for co-development. We highly support contributors in exploring different directions and achieving their own outputs (e.g., collaborating on paper submissions).
